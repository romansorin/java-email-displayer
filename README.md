# Email Displayer

Simple, primitive application made in a few hours to construct a very basic e-mail application in Java. Currently only
console based and a concept, not really a necessary application given that e-mail clients already exist. Fun, spontaneous project
to practice use of API and object-oriented structure.

## Getting Started

For simply running the application, no changes are required. Credentials are specified as:
#### Username: your_email OR your_email@gmail.com (application takes care of domain appending).
#### Password: IMPORTANT! Use an APPLICATION password generated inside of your Google account for the password. If you are unaware of how to generate this password/key, please visit https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords.

### Prerequisites

Due to being primitive and console-based, the requirements are Eclipse or a suitable/compatible IDE capable of compiling the .java
classes. No GUI is available.
